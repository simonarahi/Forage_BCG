# Forage_BCG

Forage is a platform that hosts company-backed free open-access virtual internships. These programs allow students to build career skills, gain experience and increase their understanding of different careers.

The virtual internship I have enrolled in is by BCG and is an open-access data science and advanced analytics virtual experience program, which consists of five modules. 

The .rmd file shows my attempt to the first couple tasks of the project where I start by exploring and cleaning the data given. But the task before that was to frame the business problem as a data science problem.

I was given the following:

"PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

One of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model. The client also wants to try a discounting strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective.

The Lead Data Scientist (LDS) held an initial team meeting to discuss various hypotheses, including churn due to price sensitivity. After discussion with your team, you have been asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities."

My email draft is attached under task1-business-understanding.
