Dear [LDS name],
Our client, PowerCo, is a major gas and electricity utility supplier to corporate, SME, and residential customers. PowerCo has been seeing significant customer churn due to power- liberalization of the energy market in Europe, and this churn has been mainly in the SME segment.
The hypothesis is that customer churn is being driven by price sensitivities; in other words, price changes are highly affecting the probability of customer churn. What we should do is to start by building a predictive model that would predict customer churn. This would be a classification model where the response is whether the customer churned or not, and use as much features as we can that we think could play a role in customer churn. Price change should definitely be one of them because we want to test the initial hypothesis. Other features could be related to the customer behavior and characteristics, such as the type of customer (i.e. residential, commercial, industrial), the customer demographic, their historical energy consumption, etc...

We should also have features related to the type of property of the customer and the contract type. These features are data that we will need from our client on past customers. The predictive model would be built and tested on past customers (churned and current), and then when the desired accuracy level is reached, we can use it on new customers and predict if they are likely to churn or not.
For the models that would be used, since this is a classification problem, a logistic regression framework would be a good start and then we can benchmark that against a random forest. The random forest helps also with giving us a feature importance tree which helps determine the features that are playing the most important role in predicting customer churn. Here, we would be able to test the price sensitivity hypothesis, to see if price changes are affecting customer churn as much as claimed.
Thank you. Best
